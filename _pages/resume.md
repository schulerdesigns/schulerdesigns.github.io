### Projects

##### Revolver Model (WIP):

* Developed high-poly subdivision model for baking.
* Created high-quality PBR textures based on reference images.
* Maintained efficient polygon count to allow use in real-time applications.
* Gathered significant reference to ensure proportional and functional accuracy to subject.
* Applied critique to check compatibility with industry practice. 


##### Rapier Model

* Created photorealistic hard surface model and materials based on reference images
* Demonstrated industry standard modeling practice in topology, UV packing, and polycount
* Developed cinematic, realistic render shots from multiple angles, using multiple lights and HDRI.
* Applied critique from industry professionals to ensure quality of final product


##### Hook, Line, and Axe

* Created a series of game-ready models with high-poly baking to low-poly mesh.
* Minimized polycount by triangulating and reducing low-poly mesh.
* Practiced efficient texture packing practices using single texture sets with UV space efficiency ≥ 70%.
* Developed within a sprint-based schedule for timely production of assets.
* Adapted to evolving demands of project by iterating on style, proportion, and efficiency of models at various stages of pipeline.
